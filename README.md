# Improve the Few shot learning Using CLIP
Fine-tuning the CLIP for few shot learning and fine the optimal hyperparameter configurations in terms of momentum.
- Used Datasets: Food, EuroSAT, Caltech, Flower102, Caltech101, Fgvc-aircraft, Standford Cars
- Split all the datasets into 4shot train/validation
- Evaluation of image classification is performed by top k accuracy in validation set
- Comparing the performance in FSL using different momentum methods
